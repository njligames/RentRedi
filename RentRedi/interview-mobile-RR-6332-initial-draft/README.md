# RentRedi Mobile Developer Skills Assessment

In this exercise, we're providing you a sample of some production code from our customer-facing app for renters, which we refer to as Tenants. This interface is presented when a Tenant is interested in an apartment that they see advertized for rent to view details about the property and the possible subunits, which could be rooms or partitions of a single property that are individually for rent. The interface displays a carousel of images of the property on top of some basic details about the property / unit: number of bedrooms and bathrooms, address, etc.

In this scenario, we want to provide a similar interface elsewhere in the app with a carousel of images. Imagine a feature that displays images from a recent maintenance request in the same way only with details about the maintenance request instead of the property / unit.

For this assignment:
- Initialize a new source control repository and commit these base files into it.
- Over a series of commits, refactor the current code to allow reuse of the carousel interface separately AND within the current component.
- Additionally improve the code in any way that would make it more maintainable and more readable.
- Provide a different screen that demonstrates the reusable carousel with a selection of sample images.
- Zip the entire project, including the source control repository, and submit it via Google Forms: https://forms.gle/vLhnpTQBiWiLLczk8
- Communicate with your recruiting coordinator to schedule a code review session.

> **NOTE:** We expect this assignment to take no more than 3-5 hours. None of your submission will be used for any purpose other than to evaluate your skill and experience.
